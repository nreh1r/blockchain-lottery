# Blockchain-lottery

To see code for the smartcontracts please [click here](https://github.com/nreh1r/blockchain-lottery-smartcontracts)

This repository features the front end code for a block-chain lottery. The front-end is built using Next.js, Moralis, and Web3 UI. I chose Next.js to develop this project to not only use the newest technology but also because Moralis and Web3 UI have very good integration with Next.js Moralis really does the heavy lifting when it comes to integrating a Web 3, block chain app, with a Web 2 frontend. It made creating all the UI very easy and made accessing the smart contract itself just as easy.

## Technologies/Languages Used
- Next.js
- Moralis
- Web 3 UI
- JavaScript

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
